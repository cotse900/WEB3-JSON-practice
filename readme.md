Public github demonstration of my prior work:

1. I own copyright to my individual and group work, whereas I don't own copyrights of things that I didn't write, esp. assignment and project topics.
2. Purely for demonstration and storage purposes. Do not copy anything or you would do so at your own risk.
3. Here, I have a reorganized Assignment 5 given by the lecturer, and I also used it for Assignment 6, so it feels a little different after Assignment 4.
4. I get that people would want to test heroku apps. Feel free to, but note that at the time of writing, Assignment 6 does not show department ID properly.
